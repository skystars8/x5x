[![Rust dependency audit](https://github.com/skystars8/x5x/actions/workflows/audit.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/skystars8/x5x/actions/workflows/audit.yml)

x5x combines the complete x3x collection of small, separate file-encryption
and key-tool binaries with the x4x streaming password-encryption CLI. All 22
executables remain independently usable. The workspace is pinned to Rust 1.97.1
and builds with the local Rust toolchain. Every supported platform discovers
3,291 tests: 3,289 run in the default suite and two intentionally expensive
tests are ignored unless explicitly requested.

This is new cryptographic application code and has not received an independent
security audit. Keep backups until it has been reviewed for your use case.

## Build

From this directory:

~~~text
cargo build --locked --release --bins
~~~

All 22 executables are placed in target/release. Each one can be copied and used
independently. The original cipher programs look for their fixed key file in
the current working directory; the password variants do not use key files.

## Cipher binaries

| Key binary | Password binary | Construction | Required key file | Exact key size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| aes | aesp | AES-256-GCM-SIV | aes.key | 32 bytes |
| cha | chap | XChaCha20-Poly1305 | cha.key | 32 bytes |
| ser | serp | Serpent-256-CTR with HMAC-SHA-512 | ser.key | 32 bytes |
| thf | thfp | Threefish-1024-CTR with HMAC-SHA-512 | thf.key | 128 bytes |
| asc | ascp | Ascon-AEAD128 | asc.key | 16 bytes |
| rabbit | rabbitp | Rabbit with HMAC-SHA-512 | rab.key | 16 bytes |
| aegis256 | aegis256p | AEGIS-256 | aegis256.key | 32 bytes |
| aegis128l | aegis128lp | AEGIS-128L | aegis128l.key | 16 bytes |

The AEGIS crate is compiled with its pure-Rust backend. Serpent, Threefish, and
Rabbit are unauthenticated primitives, so x3x derives independent per-file
encryption and MAC keys with HKDF-SHA-512 and authenticates the header and all
ciphertext with HMAC-SHA-512.

Implementation maturity differs by algorithm. The Serpent, Threefish, and
Rabbit dependencies are low-level hazmat primitives and have not received the
kind of independent review expected for irreplaceable-data tooling; x3x's
encrypt-then-MAC construction around them is also unaudited. The Ascon crate
likewise states that it has not received a security audit. Keep independent,
tested backups regardless of algorithm, and prefer the better-reviewed choices
for data that cannot be replaced.

Every cipher has the same interface:

~~~text
aes E filename output-file
aes D filename output-file
~~~

Replace aes with the desired binary name. The operation is exactly uppercase E
or D. Input, output, and key must be in the current working directory, and input
and output arguments must be portable Unicode filenames without path
components, ASCII control characters, Windows-invalid punctuation
(`: * ? " < > |`), trailing dots or spaces, or Windows reserved device names.
This keeps filename behavior consistent across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Outputs are never overwritten. Data is written to a private temporary file in
the same directory, flushed and synced, and installed only at successful
completion with a no-clobber operation. Authentication failure, truncation,
trailing bytes, a wrong algorithm, or a wrong key does not create the requested
output.

Cipher files use a versioned x3x container and are not raw output from the
underlying primitive. Files are streamed in 1 MiB chunks. AEAD ciphers
authenticate each chunk independently with its position and file metadata;
legacy constructions authenticate the complete ciphertext. See FORMAT.md for
the exact format.

## Password cipher binaries

The password binaries have the same file interface and add p to the command:

~~~text
aesp E filename output-file
aesp D filename output-file
~~~

Encryption prompts for the password twice; decryption prompts once. Password
input is hidden and is held in zeroizing memory. These binaries neither read
nor create an external key file.

Every encryption generates a fresh 32-byte operating-system random salt. The
password and salt are processed with Argon2id v1.3 using 512 MiB of memory, four
passes, and four lanes to derive a 64-byte root key. HKDF-SHA-512 then derives a
separate, algorithm-specific internal key of the exact required size. This
allows Threefish to receive a full 128-byte internal key without stretching a
short cipher key by repetition.

Password files use container version 2 and record their bounded KDF parameters.
The salt, algorithm, parameters, plaintext length, and all ciphertext are
authenticated by the selected construction. Key-file binaries only accept
version 1; password binaries only accept version 2 and report which matching
command to use.

Argon2id makes password guessing expensive but cannot add entropy to a weak
password. Use a long, unique passphrase. Losing the password makes the data
unrecoverable.

## Random key generator

~~~text
keygen 32
~~~

keygen accepts an exact decimal byte count from 1 through 20,000,000,000 and
streams operating-system random bytes into keygen.key. It refuses to overwrite
an existing keygen.key. Rename the result to the fixed cipher key filename when
using it.

Useful sizes are 16 bytes for asc, rabbit, or aegis128l; 32 bytes for aes, cha,
ser, or aegis256; and 128 bytes for thf.

## Deterministic password key maker

~~~text
keymake 32
~~~

keymake prompts twice without echo and streams exactly the requested number of
bytes into keymake.key. It accepts sizes from 1 through 20,000,000,000 and
refuses to overwrite an existing keymake.key.

The password and requested output size are processed with Argon2id v1.3 using
256 MiB of memory, four passes, and four lanes to derive a 64-byte root key.
SHAKE256 then expands that root as an XOF, so long output is not a repeated
short block. The same UTF-8 password and size always produce the same bytes.

Determinism means there is deliberately no random salt stored with the key:
attackers can recognize equal password-and-size inputs and perform offline
password guesses. Use a long, unique passphrase. For maximum-entropy cipher
keys, prefer keygen.

## Key text converters

~~~text
key2txt binary-key-file
txt2key decimal-text-file
~~~

key2txt streams a binary key into key2txt.txt as unsigned decimal byte values.
Every value is on its own line. A comma follows every value except the final
one, so a five-byte key is represented as:

~~~text
23,
255,
53,
9,
5
~~~

txt2key reverses this representation into txt2key.key. It requires exactly one
value from 0 through 255 per nonempty line. Plain lines without commas are also
accepted, as are CRLF line endings, surrounding ASCII spaces or tabs, and an
optional trailing comma. Signs, blank lines, multiple values on one line,
non-decimal data, more than three digits, and values above 255 are rejected.

Both tools stream in bounded memory, require the input filename to be in the
current directory, and refuse to overwrite their fixed output files. The text
representation exposes every secret key byte and must be protected just as
carefully as the original binary key.

## OTP tool

~~~text
otp file-to-process key-file
~~~

OTP is the one intentional in-place tool because its requested interface has no
output argument. It verifies that the key is at least as long as the input
before changing anything, streams both files in bounded memory, writes a
same-directory temporary file, syncs it, and atomically replaces only the named
input after revalidating that the pathname still identifies the file that was
opened. Running it again with the same key restores the original bytes.
Portable file APIs cannot make that identity check and pathname replacement one
indivisible operation, so do not run OTP in a directory concurrently writable
by an untrusted process.

OTP preserves Unix mode bits and the Windows read-only flag. Atomic replacement
cannot portably preserve ACLs, extended attributes, security labels, ownership,
timestamps, or other platform-specific metadata, so copy or restore those
separately when they matter. Symbolic-link inputs are rejected because replacing
a link would replace the link itself rather than its target.

OTP cannot authenticate its result or determine whether the supplied key is the
right one. A wrong, changed, or reused key can therefore produce a successful
command that leaves unusable data. For anything irreplaceable, run OTP only on a
verified backup and independently verify the transformed result before deleting
the original.

For actual one-time-pad security, key bytes must be uniformly random, at least
as long as the message, kept secret, and never reused for any other message.
Reusing an OTP key destroys its security.

## x4x streaming password encryption

x4x is the included cautious, streaming password-encryption application. It
uses Argon2id and XChaCha20-Poly1305, authenticates its versioned chunked
container, never overwrites a destination, and only publishes decrypted output
after the complete file verifies.

Encrypt and decrypt with hidden terminal prompts:

~~~text
x4x encrypt photo.raw
x4x decrypt photo.raw.x4x
~~~

For automation, use a protected password file rather than a command-line
password:

~~~text
x4x encrypt database.dump --password-file password.txt
x4x decrypt database.dump.x4x --password-file password.txt --output restored.dump
~~~

Encryption defaults to INPUT.x4x. Decryption removes a final lowercase .x4x
extension or otherwise appends .dec. One trailing LF or CRLF is removed from
password files; other bytes are preserved. See
[X4X_SECURITY.md](X4X_SECURITY.md) for the precise format, threat model, KDF
bounds, authenticated frame layout, and no-clobber output transaction.

## Verification

To run the original behavior/security suite for every executable, one binary
at a time, followed by the deep robustness suite for each non-x4x executable:

~~~text
.\test-each.bat
.\test-deep-each.bat
~~~

Both runners are fail-fast. test-each.bat starts a separate Cargo test target
for each of the 22 binaries and runs 21 original CLI tests per executable (462
tests). test-deep-each.bat runs 126 additional process-level robustness tests
for each of the 21 non-x4x applications (2,646 tests). The source declares 147
attributable tests per application, including x4x's 21 CLI and 126 internal
tests. One x4x test is Unix-only and one shared test is Windows-only, so the
compiled mix changes by platform while the total remains 3,291.

To run just one binary's original suite, name its bin-prefixed integration
target directly; to run one deep suite, filter the deep_apps target by module:

~~~text
cargo test --locked --test bin_aes -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --locked --test bin_keygen -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --locked --test bin_x4x -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --locked --test deep_apps -- aes::
cargo test --locked --test deep_apps -- keygen::
~~~

The broader library and cross-binary checks remain available through the usual
commands:

~~~text
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --all-targets
cargo test --locked --release --lib crypto::tests::production_password_kdf_round_trips -- --ignored --exact
cargo test --locked --test tools keymake_is_deterministic_and_not_a_repeated_short_block -- --ignored --exact
cargo audit
~~~

See [test.md](test.md) for the complete test inventory and a description of
what every unit, integration, and generated robustness test checks.

The normal tests give each executable the same 147-test attributable baseline.
They cover all eight key-file and all eight password cipher round
trips, exact chunk boundaries, empty files, fixed container compatibility
vectors, fresh nonces and salts, wrong keys and passwords, authenticated header
tampering, malformed headers, truncation, trailing data, format separation,
input immutability, no-overwrite behavior, failure cleanup, and standalone
command wiring. They also cover streamed and atomic OTP behavior, hard-link and
changed-path rejection, exact-size random key generation, deterministic
keymake domain separation and XOF streaming, actual key2txt/txt2key
process-level round trips, converter buffer boundaries, accepted text variants,
late malformed-input cleanup, and converter no-overwrite behavior. The imported x4x suite additionally covers its parser, format invariants, KDF bounds, known answers, frame corruption, truncation, splicing, races, Unicode paths, binary passwords, and transactional cleanup. The
explicitly ignored tests exercise a complete password-file round trip at its
production 512 MiB cost and run keymake's full 256 MiB settings twice. They are
separate so routine tests do not make those large allocations. `cargo audit`
requires the separately installed cargo-audit tool and checks the locked
dependency graph against the current RustSec advisory database.
